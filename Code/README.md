This is the folder for our code. Make use of VS Code's liveshare extension so we don't have like 8 billion forked repositories.


Please ask before pushing to the repository!


Track status of the implementations with the following phrases:

"not started" : File is empty

"skeletal" : File's basic structure is written

"in progress" : File implementation is being written

"debugging" : File's integrity is being tested

"ready for testing" : File is ready to test

"polished" : File has passed necessary tests


When you advance a file through the stages, please ensure that you edit the README file to reflect the status of the newly improved file.
